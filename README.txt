" A Simple node web crawler! "

You can download web pages from this!

Usage : run the "node download *https://sitelink.com* " command in the directory where download.js is located in your system.

Upon doing this a new folder will be created with a unique generated name (uuid) in the current working directory with two files in it:
  1 file.html  -  contains the html code fetched from the site
  2 url.txt    -  contains a link to the site

Project Status - (IN PROGRESS)
